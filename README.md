The repository contains the original "GAM-FORTH" game development environment for Atari 800XL, based on a modified APX Extended fig-FORTH but dependent mostly on its public domain "FIG" core and the Assembler by [Bill Ragsdale](https://github.com/BillRagsdale).

"GAM-FORTH" sources have been generously offered by Mr Pantoła to the "Polish Society for Preserving the Technical Heritage" for release to the wider Forth and Atari communities. 

The environment was used to develop 8-bit games: 
  - "A.D. 2044" (1991, 🇵🇱) - see the gameplay on [A.D. 2044 - Atari XL/XE by gregok1973 (🇵🇱)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUFI9YIeCvc). 
  - "Klątwa"/"The Curse" (1992, 🇵🇱/🇪🇳) - see the gameplay on [Klątwa for the Atari 8-bit family by Highretrogamelord (🇵🇱)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygqf9H5aB2k).
  - "Władcy Ciemności" (1993, 🇵🇱) - see the gameplay on [Władcy Ciemności - RetRozrywka GamePlay by RetRozrywka (🇵🇱)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMG_Y_y1VSs).

These three games are copyrighted by [LK Avalon](https://www.lkavalon.com/), reeditions may be available at [Retronics](https://retronics.eu/). Sources of these games are NOT available here.

"Klątwa" and "Władcy Ciemności" were also ported to Commodore C-64.

The original 5.25" floppy disks were digitized by Trub.
