# GAM-FORTH and other fig-FORTH sources by Roland Pantoła

This repository features Roland Pantoła's fig-FORTH work. It includes the original "GAM-FORTH" game development environment for Atari 800XL, based on a modified APX Extended fig-FORTH but dependent mostly on its public domain "FIG" core and the Assembler by [Bill Ragsdale](https://github.com/BillRagsdale). You can find more information about Roland here:
* [Wikipedia entry (🇵🇱)](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Panto%C5%82a)
* [Moby Games entry (🇪🇳)](https://www.mobygames.com/person/483332/roland-panto%C5%82a/)

With the generous offering from Mr. Pantoła to the [Polish Society for Preserving the Technical Heritage (🇵🇱)](https://ptodt.org.pl/about/), GAM-FORTH sources are published here with his approval for the benefit of the wider Forth and Atari communities.

Main elements of GAM-FORTH are Forth enhancements, source code Editor and a complex GRAF package (able to convert and process graphics made in [RAMbrandt](https://github.com/savetz/RAMbrandt)).

This unique environment was used to develop 8-bit games: 
  - "A.D. 2044" (1991, 🇵🇱) - see the gameplay on [A.D. 2044 - Atari XL/XE by gregok1973 (🇵🇱)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUFI9YIeCvc). 
  - "Klątwa"/"The Curse" (1992, 🇵🇱/🇪🇳) - see the gameplay on [Klątwa for the Atari 8-bit family by Highretrogamelord (🇵🇱)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygqf9H5aB2k).
  - "Władcy Ciemności" (1993, 🇵🇱) - see the gameplay on [Władcy Ciemności - RetRozrywka GamePlay by RetRozrywka (🇵🇱)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMG_Y_y1VSs).

These three games are copyrighted by [LK Avalon](https://www.lkavalon.com/), reeditions may be available at [Retronics](https://retronics.eu/). Sources of these games are NOT available here.

"Klątwa" and "Władcy Ciemności" were also ported to Commodore C-64.

The original 5.25" floppy disks were digitized by Trub.
