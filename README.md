# fig-FORTH Work by Roland Pantoła

Work in progress. Files and additional documentation are being released gradually.

This repository contains...
* the original "GAM-FORTH" game development environment for Atari 800XL, based on modified APX Extended fig-FORTH
* sources of 8-bit games created by Roland
* materials from a Forth course published in "Tajemnice Atari" (Atari Secrets) in the 1990s

These items have been generously offered by Mr Pantoła to the "Polish Society for Preserving the Technical Heritage", for release to the wider Forth and Atari communities.

The floppy disks were digitized by Mono and Trub.
